            Instructions: To play click and drag a piece on the board to another empty space.  You can only move in a diagonal line from the square of origin.
            Jumps are forced so if there is at least 1 jump available you can choose among those available but cannot move any other piece.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stage one is done, you can now play Checkers in a game with somebody else on the same computer.  Other features include forced jumps and turns.  Stage two will be in the works shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/04/2017): Checkers can now become kings when reaching the other end of the board
            and can then move backwards and forwards freely as well as jump opponent's pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/10/2017): Broke the king process then fixed it by rearranging code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/14/2017): Taking a step backwards to reduce inefficient code to be more clear and concise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/16/2017): Pieces are moving correctly both single space and jumping.  Jumping also hides a piece on the board so other pieces can capture each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/17/2017): Implemented forced jumping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (2/8/2017): Many changes made including using a preset collection of checkers instead of creating new ones each time game is started.
            Also added reset game button and a button that sets the board position based on the string you put into the text box.  r/b stand for regular checkers, R/B stand for kings,
            and - stands for empty space.  Since the board is being set up with existing checkers you can't use a string that has more than 12 of any one type of checker.  Also, movement
            is still the same for each checker based on color so if you set up the board with reverse colors you'll be stuck.

            Instructions: To play click and drag a piece on the board to another empty space.  You can only move in a diagonal line from the square of origin.
            Jumps are forced so if there is at least 1 jump available you can choose among those available but cannot move any other piece.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stage one is done, you can now play Checkers in a game with somebody else on the same computer.  Other features include forced jumps and turns.  Stage two will be in the works shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/04/2017): Checkers can now become kings when reaching the other end of the board
            and can then move backwards and forwards freely as well as jump opponent's pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/10/2017): Broke the king process then fixed it by rearranging code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/14/2017): Taking a step backwards to reduce inefficient code to be more clear and concise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/16/2017): Pieces are moving correctly both single space and jumping.  Jumping also hides a piece on the board so other pieces can capture each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/17/2017): Implemented forced jumping.

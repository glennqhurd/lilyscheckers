            This is a program currently in progress by Glenn Hurd.  Currently you
            can click and drag each checker image like you would playing the game,
            one space at a time and jumping over the other pieces.  Next up is
            turning pieces into kings and capturing pieces when they reach the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/04/2017): Checkers can now become kings when reaching the other end of the board
            and can then move backwards and forwards freely as well as jump opponent's pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/10/2017): Broke the king process then fixed it by rearranging code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Update (1/14/2017): Taking a step backwards to reduce inefficient code to be more clear and concise.
